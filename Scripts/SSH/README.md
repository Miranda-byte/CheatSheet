These are scripts to use for SSH, be carefull that there is some information needed to execute them:

1- hostname

2- port #in case its not the default 22

3- file to test the password, even thought with simple modifications, that could be changed

4- some dependencies #They are in the folder, virtualize your envroiment, and install the dependencies with pip
